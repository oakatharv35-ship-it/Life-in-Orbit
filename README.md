Astronauts face unique biological challenges in space, from muscle loss and DNA damage to immune dysfunction. But the data we have is scattered across thousands of sequencing and experiment files. Our project, Life in Orbit, integrates these datasets into a single analysis pipeline to uncover how spaceflight really impacts the human body.

We discovered that longer missions reduce sample quality, contamination levels correlate with health markers, and cell counts track with biological stress. These insights can directly guide astronaut health monitoring for long-duration missions and even help Earth-based medicine, like cancer and immune system treatments.

In short, we are using space data today to build the foundation for healthier astronauts and healthier humans tomorrow.
